<h3><p><i><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture of the United Arab Emirates is part of the culture of Eastern Arabia. Its historical population was a small tribal community 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;that changed with the arrival of an influx of foreign nationals in the mid-20th century. Emirati culture is a blend of Arabian, Islamic, 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and Persian cultures, with influences from the cultures of East Africa and Indian Subcontinent. Islam has had a prominent influence 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;on local architecture, music, attire, cuisine, and lifestyle.</h3></i></b>
